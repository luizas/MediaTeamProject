        <li>
        <h2 id="sun">Sun</h2>
        <p>The Sun is the Solar System's star and by far it's biggest component.  It is a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system.  Without the Sun's intense energy and heat, there would be no life on Earth.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <h2 id="mercury">Mercury</h2>
        <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System.  It is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Like the Moon, Mercury is covered with craters. Mercury's dayside is super heated by the Sun, but at night temperatures drop hundreds of degrees below freezing.  It takes 88 days for Mercury to orbit the Sun.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <h2 id="venus">Venus</h2>
        <p>Venus is nearly the size of Earth, only slightly smaller.  It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense.  It is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 °C (752°F), most likely due to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  Glimpses below the clouds reveal volcanoes and deformed mountains. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction of most planets and it takes 225 days to orbit the Sun.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <h2 id="earth">Earth</h2>
        <p>Earth is unique in our solar system, it is the only planet known to have current geological activity, and the only place where life is known to exist.  Other planets, plus a few moons, have ice, atmospheres, seasons and even weather, but only on Earth does the whole complicated mix come together in a way that encourages life.  It takes 365 days for Earth to orbit the Sun.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <h2 id="mars">Mars</h2>
        <p>Mars is is smaller than Earth and Venus.  It's red colour comes from iron oxide (rust) in its soil.  It possesses an atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide.  It's surface has many vast volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, and rift valleys, such as Valles Marineris.  It takes 687 days for Mars to orbit the Sun.</p>
        </li>

         <li>
        <h2 id="asteroidbelt">Asteroid Belt</h2>
        <p>Asteroids are composed mainly of refractory rocky and metallic minerals, with some ice.  They range from a few metres to hundreds of kilometres in size. Asteroids smaller than one meter are usually called meteoroids and micrometeoroids (grain-sized).<br>
        The asteroid belt occupies the orbit between Mars and Jupiter.  It is thought to be remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter.  The asteroid belt contains tens of thousands, possibly millions, of objects over one kilometre in diameter.</p>
        </li>

        
        <li>
        <h2 id="jupiter">Jupiter</h2>
        <p>Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system.  It is 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets put together.  Jupiter has four large moons and many smaller moons.  It is composed largely of hydrogen and helium.  It takes 12 years for Jupiter to orbit the Sun.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <h2 id="saturn">Saturn</h2>
        <p>Saturn is distinguished by its extensive ring system.  The rings of Saturn are made up of small ice and rock particles.   Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium.  Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 500 meters (1,600 feet) per second in the equatorial region. These super-fast winds, combined with heat rising from within the planet's interior, cause the yellow and gold bands visible in the atmosphere.  It takes 29 years for Saturn to orbit the Sun.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <h2 id="uranus">Uranus</h2>
        <p>The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel. The seventh planet from the Sun is so distant that it takes 84 years to complete one orbit.  It orbits the Sun on its side; its axial tilt is over ninety degrees to the ecliptic.  It takes 84 years for Uranus to orbit the Sun.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <h2 id="neptune">Neptune</h2>
        <p>Neptune is slightly smaller than Uranus.  Nearly 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles) from the Sun, Neptune orbits the Sun once every 165 years. It is invisible to the naked eye because of its extreme distance from Earth.  It takes 165 years for Neptune to orbit the Sun.</p>
        </li>
        
           <li>
        <h2 id="pluto">Pluto</h2>
        <p>Pluto is a dwarf planet and is the largest known object in the Kuiper belt.  When discovered in 1930, it was considered to be the ninth planet but this changed in 2006 when a formal definition of the word planet was made.  This definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as a member of the new "dwarf planet" category.  It takes 248 years for Pluto to orbit the Sun.</p>
